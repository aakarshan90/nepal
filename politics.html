<h1> POLITICS OF NEPAL: </h1>
The political landscape in Nepal has been dynamic and subject to changes. However, please note that the information provided may not reflect the current situation, and it's advisable to check more recent sources for the latest developments. Here is a general overview of the political scenario in Nepal as of early 2022:

<h3>1. Federal Democratic Republic:</h3>
Nepal officially transitioned into a federal democratic republic in 2008 with the promulgation of a new constitution. The constitution aimed to address issues of representation, inclusivity, and governance by restructuring the country into seven provinces.

<h3>2. Political Parties:</h3>

Since the promulgation of the constitution, there have been discussions and debates around amendments to address concerns raised by various groups. Some argue for changes to ensure greater representation and inclusivity, especially regarding issues related to ethnicity and marginalized communities.

<h3>4. Communist Party Split:</h3>
A significant development in recent years was the split within the Nepal Communist Party (NCP), which was previously a unified party formed through the merger of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre). The split led to the formation of two separate entities, each claiming to be the legitimate NCP.

<h3>5. Elections and Governance:</h3>
